        <h1> hello! </h1>
        <p>Hey! My name is Neil Toledo, I'm 18 (almost 19) years old, and I'm blessed to be a 2nd Year Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) major (with a probable emphasis on computer science) at UC Berkeley.  While I'm currently living in Southside Berkeley, I'm originally from Chula Vista which resides in San Diego, 7.5 miles from the border.  Unlike many others, I only began my life of computer science in the beginning of Spring 2015, when I abruptly decided to switch out of my Industrial Engineering major.</p>
        
        <p> Through school courses, I've developed a strong basis in Python and am currently studying Data Structures with Java. I've also touched upon Scheme, SQL, Arduino language, and Robot C from high school robotics.  In addition to school courses, I'm currently trying to develop my knowledge in HTML5, CSS, and Javascript through Youtube videos and practice. (ex: this website!)</p>
        
        <h1> about me! </h1>
        <p> Through my time in college, I've realized I've always had a strong affinity for the unique and the interesting.  I believe I've definitely developed this trait through my vast array of hobbies and interests.  For starters, I began establishing myself as a unique chracter in highschool, teaching myself how to not only ride but also perform several tricks on a unicycle, pen spinning, and rising to team captain of my robotics team.  Once I reached college, I developed a very very strong interest in mechanical keyboards.  I'm currently using a Poker 2 60% Keyboard, but I'm also in the process of building my own 40% keyboard.  In adddition, I've been playing a lot of Overwatch and going out for thrfit shopping.  Growing up with a strong understanding of the value of money and hardwork, I've made it a life virtue to only buy "budget" or thrifted items, and to DIY as much stuff as possible.
